Install Delphi 7.0:

Extract all files to some directory.

Open the package tscap32.dpk:

File -> Open..., choose tscap32.dpk

In the package window, choose the "Install" button.

Now, there should be an additional plane in the component palette, containing
the tscap32 Components.


Troubleshooting:

"File not found: 'tscap32_rt.dcu'" - add the directory where you put the component into to the 
Search path of the project (Project -> Options -> Tab Directories/Conditionals -> Field Search path)
